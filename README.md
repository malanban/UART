# UART
In any asynchronous interface, the first thing you need to know is when in time you should sample (look at) the data. If you do not sample the data at the right time, you might see the wrong data. In order to receive your data correctly, the transmitter and receiver must agree on the baud rate. The baud rate is the rate at which the data is transmitted. For example, 9600 baud means 9600 bits per second. The code below uses a generic in VHDL or a parameter in System Verilog to determine how many clock cycles there are in each bit. This is how the baud rate gets determined.

The FPGA is continuously sampling the line. Once it sees the line transition from high to low, it knows that a UART data word is coming. This first transition indicates the start bit. Once the beginning of the start bit is found, the FPGA waits for one half of a bit period. This ensures that the middle of the data bit gets sampled. From then on, the FPGA just needs to wait one bit period (as specified by the baud rate) and sample the rest of the data. The figure below shows how the UART receiver works inside of the FPGA. First a falling edge is detected on the serial data line. This represents the start bit. The FPGA then waits until the middle of the first data bit and samples the data. It does this for all eight data bits.
